# Strict Mode
Why?
- removes flexibility
- errors are reported

## Example Set 1
Note: demo in JavaScript first then recap in TypeScript
Example - Without `"use strict"` and without variable `let`
```
function canYouSpotTheProblem() {
  for (counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++) {
    console.log("Happy happy");
  }
}
canYouSpotTheProblem();
```
Example - With `"use strict"`
```
function canYouSpotTheProblem() {
  "use strict";
  for (counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++) {
    console.log("Happy happy");
  }
}
canYouSpotTheProblem();
```
Example - using `this` without strict mode
```
function Person(name) { this.name = name; }
let ferdinand = Person("Ferdinand");
console.log(name);
```
Example - using `this` and strict mode
```
"use strict";
function Person(name) { this.name = name; }
let ferdinand = Person("Ferdinand");
// forgot new
// → TypeError: Cannot set property 'name' of undefined
```
Example - correct use with `new` keyword
```
"use strict";
function Person(name) { this.name = name; }
let ferdinand = new Person("Ferdinand");
```


## Example Set 2
Note: demo in JavaScript first then recap in TypeScript
Example - variable, without declaration
```
x = 600;
// This will cause an error because x is not declared
```
Example - variable, without declaration
```
x = {p1:10, p2:20};
// This will cause an error because x is not declared
```
Example - delete a variable
```
x = {p1:10, p2:20};
delete x;
```
Example - duplicate parameter name
```
function add(p1, p1) {};
```
Example - writing to a get-only property
```
var obj = {get x() {return 0} };
obj.x = 300;
```
# Types
Why?
- Less confusion on what kind of value goes in and out
Note: demo in JavaScript first then recap in TypeScript
```
// {saying: string} -> string
function tellAJoke(saying) {
  return saying + "hahaha"
}
```
# Tests
Why?
If the language is not going to do much to help us find mistakes, we’ll have to find them the hard way: by running the program and seeing whether it does the right thing.

Doing this by hand, again and again, is a really bad idea. Not only is it annoying, it also tends to be ineffective since it takes too much time to exhaustively test everything every time you make a change.

Unit Test
- What: Unit testing is usually an automated process and performed within the programmers IDE. Unit testing is an action used to validate that separate units of source code remains working properly. ly. Example: - A function, method, Loop or statement in program is working fine. It is executed by the Developer.
- Why: Unit testing is important because it is one of the earliest testing efforts performed on the code and the earlier defects are detected, the easier they are to fix.

Let's create our own
- arrange
- act
- assert

Arrange/Act/Assert (AAA) is a pattern for arranging and formatting code in Unit Test methods.

It is a best practice to author your tests in more natural and convenient way. The idea is to develop a unit test by following these 3 simple steps:

Arrange – setup the testing objects and prepare the prerequisites for your test.
Act – perform the actual work of the test.
Assert – verify the result.

Example - arrange, act, and assert
```
function addTwoElements(arr: number[]): number {
  return arr[0] + arr[1];
}

function assertEquals(expected: number, actual: number): boolean {
  if (expected === actual) {
    return true
  }
  return false
}

// arrange
const expected = 2;
const parameter = [1,1];

// act
const actual = addTwoElements(parameter);

// assert
const isEqual = assertEquals(expected, actual);
console.log(isEqual);
```
Example - Make multiple test from scratch
```
function addTwoElements(arr: number[]): number {
  return arr[0] + arr[1];
}

function assertEquals(expected: number, actual: number): boolean {
  if (expected === actual) {
    return true
  }
  return false
}

function printTests() {
  for (let i = 0; i < isEqual.length; i++) {
    console.log(`test ${i} ${isEqual[i]}`);
  }
}

let isEqual: boolean[] = [];
isEqual.push(assertEquals(addTwoElements([2,3]), 5));
isEqual.push(assertEquals(addTwoElements([5,3]), 5));
printTests();
```
# Debugging
Why?
- The next step after you run a program that misbehaves or produces an error is to debug and figure out what the problem is.

What are Breakpoints?
- A line number of interest. Halts the execution of the program.
- In software development, a breakpoint is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for debugging purposes. It is also sometimes simply referred to as a pause. More generally, a breakpoint is a means of acquiring knowledge about a program during its execution.
- In VS Code, you can add a break point by clicking at the left side of the code number line. It should create a red dot.

What is Continue?
- An action to take in the debugger that will continue execution until the next breakpoint is reached or the program exits.

What is Step Over?
– An action to take in the debugger that will step over a given line. If the line contains a function the function will be executed and the result returned without debugging each line.

What is Step into?
- An action to take in the debugger. If the line does not contain a function it behaves the same as “step over” but if it does the debugger will enter the called function and continue line-by-line debugging there.

What is Step out?
– An action to take in the debugger that returns to the line where the current function was called.

```
console.log
```
Example:
```
function lastElement(array) {
  if (array.length == 0) {
    return {failed: true};
  } else {
    return {element: array[array.length - 1]};
  }
}
```
# Debugging in Chrome
We need to add `sourceMap` in the `tsconfig.json`
- So that the TypeScript code could be linked in JavaScript
- Whenever TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, it will create the corresponding source map
Example 1
```
function hello(name: string) {
  return "hello" + name;
}

console.log(hello("Josh"));
```
Execute:
```
tsc demo.ts --sourcemap
```
Example 2
```
function loop(size: number) {
  const ary = []
  const min = 0;
  for (let max = 1; max <= size; max++) {
    let rand = Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min)
    ary.push(rand);
  }
  return ary;
}

const max = 100;
const min = 1;
const size = Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min);

const res = loop(size);
console.log('Created an array with ' + res.length + ' results.');
console.log(res.join(', '));
```

# Error Propagation
## Example Set 1
Example - Fault is executed `for (let i = arr.length - 1; i > 0; i--)` but no error state.
```
function findIndex (arr: number[], x: number): number {
  for (let i = arr.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    if(arr[i] == x) {
      return i;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}

const test = findIndex([10,20,30,40,50], 20);
console.log(test);
```
Example - Fault is executed `for (let i = arr.length - 1; i > 0; i--)` and error state.
```
function findIndex (arr: number[], x: number): number {
  for (let i = arr.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    if(arr[i] == x) {
      return i;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}

const test = findIndex([10,20,30,40,50], 10);
console.log(test);
```
Fix: Change `i > 0` to `i >= 0`
## Example Set 2
Example -
```
function countNegative(arr: number[]): number {
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] <= 0) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
}

const test = countNegative([-1,11,0,-2]);
console.log(test);
```
Example - Not execute faulty statement
```
function countNegative(arr: number[]): number {
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] <= 0) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
}

const test = countNegative([]);
console.log(test);
```
# Exception Handling
Error handling is important because it makes it easier for the end users of your code to use it correctly. ... If you don't handle your errors, your program may crash, lose all of your customers work and you likely won't know where the bug occurred (provided you don't handle your fatal exception with a stack trace).
- First, it lets the user know, in a relatively friendly manner, that something has gone wrong and that they should contact the technical support department or that someone from tech support has been notified. As we all know there's a HUGE difference between receiving a rather nasty, tech riddled notice that says something like "Object not set to reference of an object" etc. ... and receiving a nice popup type window that says "There has been an issue. Please contact the helpdesk".
- Second it allows the programmer to put in some niceties to aid in the debugging of issues. For instance ... in my code, I typically write a custom error handler that takes in a number of parameters and spits back a nice, formatted message that can either be emailed to the helpdesk, stashed in an event log, written to a log file etc.. The error message will contain as much info as I can cram in there to help me figure out what happened, stack traces, function parameters, database calls ... you name it. I like verbose error messages to help me figure out what actually happened. The user never has to see any of it, they get the nice, friendly message above, letting them know that someone can figure out what's going on.

Statements
- The `try` statement lets you test a block of code for errors.
- The `catch` statement lets you handle the error.
- The `throw` statement lets you create custom errors.
- The `finally` statement lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result.


```
try {
  throw new Error('Something bad happened');
}
catch(e) {
  console.log(e);
}
```
Example - from the text book
Note: Copy paste, Show in JS, refresh browser
```
function promptDirection(question){
  let result = prompt(question);
  if (result.toLowerCase() == "left") return "L";
  if (result.toLowerCase() == "right") return "R";
  throw new Error("Invalid direction: " + result);
}

function look() {
  if (promptDirection("Which way?") == "L") {
    return "a house";
  } else {
    return "two angry bears";
  }
}

try {
    console.log("You see", look());
} catch (error) {
    console.log("Something went wrong: " + error);
} finally {
  console.log("Thanks for trying the program");
}
```

# Files
## `loader.js`
- Location: node_modules > html-webpack-plugin > lib > loader.js
- html-webpack-plugin: https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin
- html-webpack-plugin: This is a webpack plugin that simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your webpack bundles. This is especially useful for webpack bundles that include a hash in the filename which changes every compilation. You can either let the plugin generate an HTML file for you, supply your own template using lodash templates or use your own loader. The html-webpack-plugin provides hooks to extend it to your needs. There are already some really powerful plugins which can be integrated with zero configuration.


## `async_hooks.js`, `events.js`
Location: node_modules > pn > async_hook.js
- pn: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pn
- pn: The pn library gives you the Promise-using node standard library you've always dreamed of. Think "Promised Node" when saying it. Just about every node standard library method that takes a callback will now return a Promise iff no callback is supplied. But existing code that passes callbacks will still work fine --- and fast: No unnecessary Promises are created if you supply a callback. The wrappers are generated automatically by a script, with a table to handle exceptions and odd cases. See below for more details.

## `console.js`
Location: node_modules > mock
- mock:
- mock:
NOTE: Not complete

## `util.js`
NOTE: Not complete

# Tips
## TypeScript
Use a `tsconfig.json` for compilation
```
tsc -p tsconfig.json
```
## Chrome
Shorcut to open the Console panel
- command + option + j
- control + shift + j
