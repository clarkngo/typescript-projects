# Module 3 - Functions with JavaScript and TypeScript

# Module 2 Recap
## Objects
### Create an Object with types
```
const mighty_morphin: { [key: string]: string | string[] } = {
  "tv-show": "Power Rangers",
  "rangers": ["red", "blue", "black", "pink", "yellow"]
};
```
### Access using dot notation
### Access using bracket notation
### Nested objects
Example - using pipe operator and object keyword
```
const mighty_morphin: object | {[key: string]: string} = {
  "tv-show": "Power Rangers",
  "rangers": {
    "color": "red",
  }
};
```
Example - defining a type
```
type Rangers = {
  rangers: object;
}

const mighty_morphin: Rangers | {[key: string]: string} = {
  "tv-show": "Power Rangers",
  "rangers": {
    "color": "red",
  }
};
```
Example - defining a type nested
```
type RangerColor = {
  color: string;
}

type Rangers = {
  rangers: RangerColor;
}


const mighty_morphin: Rangers | {[key: string]: string} = {
  "tv-show": "Power Rangers",
  "rangers": {
    "color": "red",
  }
};
```
## Arrays
### Create an array
```
const arr: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```
### Access an element
### Iterate using for loop
```
for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
  console.log(arr[i]);
}
```

# Module 3

## Functions
### Named functions
Example 1
```
function sing(word: string): string {
  return word + ' good good';
}

console.log(sing('disco'));
```
Example 2 - Area of a circle
```
function areaOfCircle(radius: number): number {
  const pi = 3.14;
  return radius * pi;
}
```
Example 3 - Scope
```
function areaOfCircle(radius: number): number {
  const pi = 3.14;
  return radius * pi;
}

console.log(pi) // Cannot find name 'pi'
```
Example 3 - No local binding
```
function wrapValue(n: number): number {
  let local = n;
  return n;
}

let wrap1 = wrapValue(1);
let wrap2 = wrapValue(2);
console.log(wrap1);
console.log(wrap2);
```
Example 4 - With local binding
```
function wrapValue(n: number): Function {
  let local = n;
  return () => local;
}

let wrap1 = wrapValue(1);
let wrap2 = wrapValue(2);
console.log(wrap1());
// → 1
console.log(wrap2());
// → 2
```
Example 6 - Nested functions 1
Note: Error - Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'name'

See `lib.dom.d.ts` file
```
declare const name: never;
```
I believe this behavior is by design. By default, TypeScript uses the DOM typings for the global execution environment and there is a name property on the global window in the DOM. In this case, TypeScript is providing a potentially helpful error message, provided the script is executed in a browser at least.

TL;DR Just write export {} in the outermost scope of your files.
Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40900791/cannot-redeclare-block-scoped-variable-in-unrelated-files
```
let name = "John";

function sayHi() {
  alert("Hi, " + name);
}

name = "Pete";

sayHi(); // what will it show: "John" or "Pete"?
```
Example 7 - Nested functions 2
```
function makeWorker() {
  let name = "Pete";

  return function() {
    console.log(name);
  };
}

let name = "John";

// create a function
let work = makeWorker();

// call it
work(); // what will it show? "Pete" (name where created) or "John" (name where called)?

```
Example 7 - Assigning a return value to a variable
```
function areaOfCircle(radius: number): number {
  const pi = 3.14;
  return radius * pi;
}

let circle1 = areaOfCircle(4);
console.log(circle1);
```

### Function expression
```
let sing = function(word: string): string {
  return word + ' good good';
}

console.log(sing('disco'));
```

### Anonymous function
```
let sing = (word: string): string => {
  return word + ' good good';
}

console.log(sing('disco'));
```
### Anonymous function
```
let sing = (word: string): string => word + ' good good';

console.log(sing('disco'));
```
### Return a function
```
const greet = new Function('name',
`return 'hello '  + name`)

console.log(greet);
```
#### Optional Parameters

```
function buildName(firstName: string, lastName?: string) {
  if (lastName)
      return firstName + " " + lastName;
  else
      return firstName;
}

console.log(buildName('Clark'));
console.log(buildName('Clark', 'Jason', 'Ngo')); // Expected 1-2 arguments, but got 3
console.log(buildName('Clark', 'Ngo'));
```

#### Default Parameters
```
function buildKid(firstName: string, age = 0) {
  return `Your baby's name is ${firstName} and his age is ${age}.`
}
console.log(buildKid('Goku')); // Your baby's name is Goku and his age is 0.
console.log(buildKid('Goku', undefined)); // Will produce the default
console.log(buildKid('Goku', 14, 0)); // Expected 1-2 arguments, but got 3
```

# Muddiest Point
## Are most functions impure?  or pure? I'm not sure which one is more common.

Answer: You almost always encounter impure functions. Let's talk more on Module 4.

## All of the function explanations seemed easy to understand but i think the complex functions like we saw in the powerpoint today are muddy to me. Side effects were muddy too.
- Modifying any external variable or object property (e.g., a global variable, or a variable in the parent function scope chain)
- Logging to the console
- Writing to the screen
- Writing to a file
- Writing to the network
- Triggering any external process
- Calling any other functions with side-effects

Let's talk about this more in Module 4

## When would you use a recursive function?
Example - Factorial without recursion
```
function factorialize(num: number): number {
  var result = num;
  if (num === 0 || num === 1)
    return 1;
  while (num > 1) {
    num--;
    result *= num;
  }
  return result;
}
factorialize(5);
```
Example - Factorial with recursion
```
function factorialize(num: number): number {
  if (num < 0)
        return -1;
  else if (num == 0)
      return 1;
  else {
      return (num * factorialize(num - 1));
  }
}
factorialize(5);
```
Example - Fibonacci without recursion
```
function fibonacci(num: number): number{
  let a = 1, b = 0, temp;

  while (num >= 0){
    temp = a;
    a = a + b;
    b = temp;
    num--;
  }

  return b;
}
```
Example - Fibonacci with recursion
```
function fibonacci(num: number): number {
  if (num <= 1) return 1;

  return fibonacci(num - 1) + fibonacci(num - 2);
}
```
Answer:

There are a number of good explanations of recursion in this thread, this answer is about why you shouldn't use it in most languages.* In the majority of major imperative language implementations (i.e. every major implementation of C, C++, Basic, Python, Ruby,Java, and C#) iteration is vastly preferable to recursion.

To see why, walk through the steps that the above languages use to call a function:

1. space is carved out on the stack for the function's arguments and local variables
2. the function's arguments are copied into this new space
control jumps to the function
3. the function's code runs
4. the function's result is copied into a return value
5. the stack is rewound to its previous position
control jumps back to where the function was called
6. Doing all of these steps takes time, usually a little bit more than it takes to iterate through a loop. However, the real problem is in step #1. When many programs start, they allocate a single chunk of memory for their stack, and when they run out of that memory (often, but not always due to recursion), the program crashes due to a stack overflow.

So in these languages recursion is slower and it makes you vulnerable to crashing. There are still some arguments for using it though. In general, code written recursively is shorter and a bit more elegant, once you know how to read it.

Extra: Factorial with comments using recursion
```
function factorialize(num: number): number {
  // If the number is less than 0, reject it.
  if (num < 0)
        return -1;

  // If the number is 0, its factorial is 1.
  else if (num == 0)
      return 1;

  // Otherwise, call the recursive procedure again
    else {
        return (num * factorialize(num - 1));
        /*
        First Part of the recursion method
        You need to remember that you won’t have just one call, you’ll have several nested calls

        Each call: num === "?"        	         num * factorialize(num - 1)
        1st call – factorialize(5) will return    5  * factorialize(5 - 1) // factorialize(4)
        2nd call – factorialize(4) will return    4  * factorialize(4 - 1) // factorialize(3)
        3rd call – factorialize(3) will return    3  * factorialize(3 - 1) // factorialize(2)
        4th call – factorialize(2) will return    2  * factorialize(2 - 1) // factorialize(1)
        5th call – factorialize(1) will return    1  * factorialize(1 - 1) // factorialize(0)

        Second part of the recursion method
        The method hits the if condition, it returns 1 which num will multiply itself with
        The function will exit with the total value

        5th call will return (5 * (5 - 1))     // num = 5 * 4
        4th call will return (20 * (4 - 1))    // num = 20 * 3
        3rd call will return (60 * (3 - 1))    // num = 60 * 2
        2nd call will return (120 * (2 - 1))   // num = 120 * 1
        1st call will return (120)             // num = 120

        If we sum up all the calls in one line, we have
        (5 * (5 - 1) * (4 - 1) * (3 - 1) * (2 - 1)) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
        */
    }
}
factorialize(5);

  // Step 1. Create a variable result to store num
  var result = num;

  // If num = 0 OR num = 1, the factorial will return 1

    return 1;

  // Step 2. Create the WHILE loop
  while (num > 1) {
    num--; // decrementation by 1 at each iteration
    result = result * num; // or result *= num;

## I dont get it why is function in JS like this below
```
function myFunction (a,b) {

    return a+b;

}
```
and function in TS like this below. I thought we were only adding the type annotation for TS.
```
const function = (a,b) => {

    return a+b;

};
```
What does => mean?

Answer:
Arrowhead operator. It's a syntax of anonymous function.

## Could we go over in class how recursion "bubbles up" through the call stack?

```
function greet(who) {
  console.log("Hello " + who);
}
greet("Harry");
console.log("Bye");
```

Sequence 1:
```
CALL STACK
///////////////////////////////
/                             /
/ "Hello" + who               /
/ console.log("Hello " + who) /
/ greet("Harry")              /
///////////////////////////////
```
Sequence 2:
```
CALL STACK
///////////////////////////////
/                             /
/ console.log("Bye")          /
///////////////////////////////
```

Call stack for Factorial
```
CALL STACK
/////////////////////////////
/                           /
/ factorial(1)              /
/ factorial(2)              /
/ factorial(3)              /
/ factorial(4)              /
/ factorial(5)              /
/ console.log(factorial(5)) /
/////////////////////////////
```
Sequence:
1.  `console.log(factorial(5))` is pushed in the stack
2.  `factorial(4)` is pushed in the stack
3.  `factorial(3)` is pushed in the stack
4.  `factorial(2)` is pushed in the stack
5.  `factorial(1)` is pushed in the stack
6.  `factorial(1)` returns 1 and pops out of the stack
7.  `factorial(2)` returns 2 * 1 and pops out of the stack
8.  `factorial(3)` returns 3 * 2 and pops out of the stack
9.  `factorial(4)` returns 4 * 6 and pops out of the stack
10. `factorial(5)` returns 5 * 24 and pops out of the stack
10. `console.log(factorial(5))` logs `120` onto the console and pops out of the stack

## Abstraction Repetition
Example: addition
```
let a: number;
let b: number;

// modification
a = 1;
b = 2;

// calculation
const sum: number = a + b;

// output
console.log(a+b);
```
Example: addition function
```
function add(x: number, y: number): number {
    return x + y;
}

// output
console.log(add(1,2));
```
Abstraction is the act of representing essential features without including the background details or explanations. In the computer science and software engineering domain, the abstraction principle is used to reduce complexity and allow efficient design and implementation of complex software systems.
Source: https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3736/abstraction

In object-oriented programming, abstraction is one of three central principles (along with encapsulation and inheritance). Through the process of abstraction, a programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency

## I apologize for the late submission on this. After reading the text and reviewing the text and typescript tutorial, I am curious about functions and seeing them applied to examples. I have done some previous programming with functions in other languages and would like to understand functions a bit more in JS. I am sure we will get many examples in today's lecture but I am hoping I can connect the syntax and structure a bit better in creating them through examples and practice in today's assignments.
