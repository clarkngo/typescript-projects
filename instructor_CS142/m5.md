# Module 5 - Object-Oriented Programming with JavaScript and TypeScript

# Module 4 Recap
## Higher-order
### Map, filter, reduce

# Module 5
## Classes
```
class Greeter {
  greeting: string;
  constructor(message: string) {
    this.greeting = message;
  }
  greet() {
    return "Hello, " + this.greeting;
  }
}

let greeter = new Greeter("world");
```

- class property `greeting`
- a constructor
- method `greet`
- instance of `Greeter` with `new`
- refer to the member class `this` and denotes member access

## Inheritance
```
class Animal {
  move(distanceInMeters: number = 0) {
    console.log(`Animal moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  bark() {
    console.log('Woof! Woof!');
  }
}

const dog = new Dog();
dog.bark();
dog.move(10);
dog.bark();
```
- classes inherit properties and methods from base classes
- `Dog` is a derived class from `Animal` base class using the `extends` keyword
- derived classes are often called subclasses
- bass classes are often called superclasses
- Because Dog extends the functionality from Animal, we were able to create an instance of Dog that could both bark() and move().

Complex Example:
```
class Animal {
  name: string;
  constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }
  move(distanceInMeters: number = 0) {
    console.log(`${this.name} moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);
  }
}

class Snake extends Animal {
  constructor(name: string) { super(name); }
  move(distanceInMeters = 5) {
    console.log("Slithering...");
    super.move(distanceInMeters);
  }
}

class Horse extends Animal {
  constructor(name: string) { super(name); }
  move(distanceInMeters = 45) {
    console.log("Galloping...");
    super.move(distanceInMeters);
  }
}

let sam = new Snake("Sammy the Python");
let tom: Animal = new Horse("Tommy the Palomino");

sam.move();
tom.move(34);
```

## Public, private, and protected modifiers

### Public
You may still mark a member public explicitly. We could have written the Animal class from the previous section in the following way:
```
class Animal {
  public name: string;
  public constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }
  public move(distanceInMeters: number) {
      console.log(`${this.name} moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);
  }
}
```
### Private
```
class Animal {
  private name: string;
  constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }
}

new Animal("Cat").name; // Error: 'name' is private;
```
Example 2:
```
class Animal {
  private name: string;
  constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }
}

class Rhino extends Animal {
  constructor() { super("Rhino"); }
}

class Employee {
  private name: string;
  constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }
}

let animal = new Animal("Goat");
let rhino = new Rhino();
let employee = new Employee("Bob");

animal = rhino;
animal = employee; // Error: 'Animal' and 'Employee' are not compatible
```
### Protected
```
class Person {
  protected name: string;
  constructor(name: string) { this.name = name; }
}

class Employee extends Person {
  private department: string;

  constructor(name: string, department: string) {
    super(name);
    this.department = department;
  }

  public getElevatorPitch() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I work in ${this.department}.`;
  }
}

let howard = new Employee("Howard", "Sales");
console.log(howard.getElevatorPitch());
console.log(howard.name); // error
```
### Readonly
```
class Octopus {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly numberOfLegs: number = 8;
  constructor (theName: string) {
      this.name = theName;
  }
}
let dad = new Octopus("Man with the 8 strong legs");
dad.name = "Man with the 3-piece suit"; // error! name is readonly.
console.log(dad.name)
```
### Accessors
Let’s convert a simple class to use `get` and `set`. First, let’s start with an example without getters and setters.
```
class Employee {
  fullName: string;
}

let employee = new Employee();
employee.fullName = "Bob Smith";
if (employee.fullName) {
  console.log(employee.fullName);
}
```
### Static Properties
We can also create static members of a class, those that are visible on the class itself rather than on the instances. In this example, we use static on the origin, as it’s a general value for all grids.
```
class Grid {
    static origin = {x: 0, y: 0};
    calculateDistanceFromOrigin(point: {x: number; y: number;}) {
        let xDist = (point.x - Grid.origin.x);
        let yDist = (point.y - Grid.origin.y);
        return Math.sqrt(xDist * xDist + yDist * yDist) / this.scale;
    }
    constructor (public scale: number) { }
}

let grid1 = new Grid(1.0);  // 1x scale
let grid2 = new Grid(5.0);  // 5x scale

console.log(grid1.calculateDistanceFromOrigin({x: 10, y: 10}));
console.log(grid2.calculateDistanceFromOrigin({x: 10, y: 10}));
```
### Abstract Classes
Abstract classes are base classes from which other classes may be derived. They may not be instantiated directly. Unlike an interface, an abstract class may contain implementation details for its members. The abstract keyword is used to define abstract classes as well as abstract methods within an abstract class.
```
abstract class Animal {
  abstract makeSound(): void;
  move(): void {
    console.log("roaming the earth...");
  }
}
```


# Private and protected properties method
In object-oriented programming, properties and methods are split into two groups:

Internal interface – methods and properties, accessible from other methods of the class, but not from the outside.

External interface – methods and properties, accessible also from outside the class.


If we continue the analogy with the coffee machine – what’s hidden inside: a boiler tube, heating element, and so on – is its internal interface.

An internal interface is used for the object to work, its details use each other. For instance, a boiler tube is attached to the heating element.

But from the outside a coffee machine is closed by the protective cover, so that no one can reach those. Details are hidden and inaccessible. We can use its features via the external interface.

So, all we need to use an object is to know its external interface. We may be completely unaware how it works inside, and that’s great.

In JavaScript, there are two types of object fields (properties and methods):

Public: accessible from anywhere. They comprise the external interface. Till now we were only using public properties and methods.
Private: accessible only from inside the class. These are for the internal interface.

Example - Unprotecting water amount
Please use JSBIN
https://jsbin.com/qifinizuta/1/edit?js,console
```
class CoffeeMachine {
  waterAmount = 0; // the amount of water inside

  constructor(power) {
    this.power = power;
    alert( `Created a coffee-machine, power: ${power}` );
  }

}

// create the coffee machine
let coffeeMachine = new CoffeeMachine(100);

// add water
coffeeMachine.waterAmount = 200;
```
Example - Protecting water amount

Protected properties are usually prefixed with an underscore _.

That is not enforced on the language level, but there’s a well-known convention between programmers that such properties and methods should not be accessed from the outside.


Now the access is under control, so setting the water below zero fails.

```
class CoffeeMachine {
  _waterAmount = 0;

  set waterAmount(value) {
    if (value < 0) throw new Error("Negative water");
    this._waterAmount = value;
  }

  get waterAmount() {
    return this._waterAmount;
  }

  constructor(power) {
    this._power = power;
  }

}

// create the coffee machine
let coffeeMachine = new CoffeeMachine(100);

// add water
coffeeMachine.waterAmount = -10; // Error: Negative water
```

Now the access is under control, so setting the water below zero fails.

Read-only “power”
For power property, let’s make it read-only. It sometimes happens that a property must be set at creation time only, and then never modified.

That’s exactly the case for a coffee machine: power never changes.

To do so, we only need to make getter, but not the setter:
```
class CoffeeMachine {
  _waterAmount = 0;

  set waterAmount(value) {
    if (value < 0) throw new Error("Negative water");
    this._waterAmount = value;
  }

  get waterAmount() {
    return this._waterAmount;
  }

  constructor(power) {
    this._power = power;
  }

}

// create the coffee machine
let coffeeMachine = new CoffeeMachine(100);

alert(`Power is: ${coffeeMachine.power}W`); // Power is: 100W

coffeeMachine.power = 25; // Error (no setter)
```


Here we used getter/setter syntax.

But most of the time get.../set... functions are preferred, like this:

```
class CoffeeMachine {
  _waterAmount = 0;

  setWaterAmount(value) {
    if (value < 0) throw new Error("Negative water");
    this._waterAmount = value;
  }

  getWaterAmount() {
    return this._waterAmount;
  }
}

new CoffeeMachine().setWaterAmount(100);
```

# Muddiest Points

## What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to portray different forms depending on how and where it's used.

Example 1 - Let’s say we run a car rental service. So in our `Car` class, we have three methods, `Rent`, `Record` and `Return`
```
class Car {
  Rent(type:string) : this {
    console.log(`${type} has been rented.`);
    return this;
  }

  Record() : this {
    console.log(`Car was rented at ${new Date().toLocaleString()}`);
    return this;
  }

  Return(type:string) : this {
    console.log(`${type} has been returned.`);
    return this;
  }
}
```
Example 2 - The methods in our `Car` class return this. This makes our methods polymorphic. It will become clearer as we move along. Let’s create two new classes namely `ElectricCar` and `GasCar` which both extend the `Car` class.
```
class ElectricCar extends Car {
  Charge() : this {
    console.log(`Electric car has been charged.`);
    return this;
  }
}

class GasCar extends Car {
  Refill() : this {
    console.log(`Gas car has been refilled.`);
    return this;
  }
}
```
Just like the methods in the Car class, both methods in ElectricCar and GasCar return this.

Let’s say, someone wants to rent an electric car, so we create an instance of the ElectricCar class. Since we need to charge the car before giving it to the customer, we call the Charge method that exists in our ElectricCar class. Now, because our Charge method returns this, we can immediately chain our Rent method from our Car class.

Our final code will look like this:
```
let electricCar = new ElectricCar();
electricCar
  .Rent("Electric car") // Electric car has been rented.
  .Record() // logs current date and time
```
Here, we see the effect of polymorphism. That is, even though the this returned from the Record method will normally be an instance of the Car class which does not contain a Charge method, we are still able to call the Charge method because the this keyword now represents an instance of the ElectricCar class. In short, the this keyword has changed form and that is exactly what polymorphism is.

Another display of polymorphism is shown in the code below. By creating an instance of the GasCar class, we can call Refill after Record in our method chaining as opposed to Charge in the electricCar example. Once again, our this has changed it’s form.
```
let gasCar = new GasCar();
gasCar
  .Rent("Gas car") // Gas car has been rented.
  .Record() // logs current date and time

gasCar.Return("Gas car") // Gas car has been returned.
  .Record() // logs current date and time.
  .Refill() // Gas car has been refilled.
```
By leveraging the Polymorphic this type , we can create an API that returns different result based on how it’s called.

## Prototypes, i would like to go over this topic tomorrow during your lecture.  Like what does it mean objects will have their own prototype as a fall back.
### First set of examples
Example 1
```
const body = {
  init: function (part) {
    this.part = part
    console.log(this)
  },
  touch: function() {
    console.log('you touched my ' + this.part)
  }
}

body.init('nose');
body.touch();
```
Example 2
```
const body = {
  init: function (part) {
    this.part = part
  },
  touch: function() {
    console.log('you touched my ' + this.part)
  }
}

const nose = Object.create(body);
nose.init('nose');
nose.touch();
```
Example 2
```
const body = {
  init: function (part) {
    this.part = part
  },
  touch: function() {
    console.log('you touched my ' + this.part)
  }
}

const nose = Object.create(body);
nose.init('nose');
nose.touch();

const lips = Object.create(body);
lips.init('lips');
lips.touch();
```
Example 3 - Does Object.create make copies?
```
const body = {
  init: function (part) {
    this.part = part
  },
  touch: function() {
    console.log('you touched my ' + this.part)
  }
}

const nose = Object.create(body);
const lips = Object.create(body);

body.touch = function() {
  console.log('YOU HAVE YUMMY ' + this.part.toUpperCase())
}

nose.init('nose');
nose.touch();

lips.init('lips');
lips.touch();
```
- `Object.create` creates a new empty object and assigns `body` as the fallback
- It does not, it checks if `nose` has the `touch` function, if no, checks the prototype (the fallback), which is `body`, if it has the `touch` function. Else, `undefined`.

Example 4 - Fallback not used
```
const body = {
  init: function (part) {
    this.part = part
  },
  touch: function() {
    console.log('you touched my ' + this.part)
  }
}

const nose = Object.create(body);

nose.init('nose');
nose.touch();
body.part = 'you never know >_<';
nose.touch(); // it has a 'part', no need for fallback to 'body'

// console.log(nose);
```
Example 4 - Fallback used
```
const body = {
  init: function (part) {
    this.part = part
  },
  touch: function() {
    console.log('you touched my ' + this.part)
  }
}

const nose = Object.create(body);

// nose.init('nose');
nose.touch();
body.part = 'you never know >_<';
nose.touch(); // fallbacks to 'body.part' because 'nose' doesn't have 'part'

// console.log(nose); // {}
```
Example 4 - Checking for prototypes
```
const body = {
  init: function (part) {
    this.part = part
  },
  touch: function() {
    console.log('you touched my ' + this.part)
  }
}

const nose = Object.create(body);

nose.init('nose');
nose.touch();

console.log('nose is', body.isPrototypeOf(nose));
console.log('number', body.isPrototypeOf(13));
console.log('belly is', body.isPrototypeOf(belly));
```

### Second set of examples
Example 1
```
function talk() {
  console.log(this);        // global object
  console.log(this.sound);  // undefined
}

let animal = {
  talk: talk
}
```
Example 2
```
function talk() {
  console.log(this); // the animal object { talk: [Function: talk] }
  console.log(this.sound);  // undefined
}

let animal = {
  talk: talk        // key: talk, value: function talk()
}

animal.talk()
```
Example 3 - Omitting if key value is same name
```
function talk() {
  console.log(this); // the animal object { talk: [Function: talk] }
  console.log(this.sound);  // undefined
}

let animal = {
  talk       // key: talk, value: function talk()
}

animal.talk()
```
Example 4 - human without a talk function
```
function talk() {
  console.log(this); // the animal object { talk: [Function: talk] }
  console.log(this.sound);  // undefined
}

let animal = {
  talk       // key: talk, value: function talk()
}

let human = {
  sound: 'hey how are you?'
}

human.talk() // Error: not a function
```
Example 5 - Human with a talk function
```
function talk() {
  console.log(this.sound);  // 'meow!'
}

let person = {
  talk       // key: talk, value: function talk()
}

let human = {
  sound: 'hey how are you?'
}

Object.setPrototypeOf(human, animal);
human.talk() // { sound: 'hey how are you?'}
            // hey how are you?
```
- set `human` to have `animal` as the prototype
Example 6 - second example
```
function talk() {
  console.log(this.sound);  // 'meow!'
}

let animal = {
  talk       // key: talk, value: function talk()
}

let human = {
  sound: 'hey how are you?'
}

let pig = {
  sound: "abadee abadee that's all folks"
}

Object.setPrototypeOf(human, animal);
human.talk() // hey how are you?
Object.setPrototypeOf(pig, animal);
pig.talk() // abadee abadee that's all folks
```

Example 7 - prototying to a different object
```
function talk() {
  console.log(this.sound);  // 'meow!'
}

let animal = {
  talk       // key: talk, value: function talk()
}

let human = {
  sound: 'hey how are you?'
}

let pig = {
  sound: "abadee abadee that's all folks"
}

let angry_pig = {
  shout: function() {
    console.log(this.sound.toUpperCase())
  }
}

Object.setPrototypeOf(human, animal);
human.talk() // hey how are you?
Object.setPrototypeOf(pig, animal);
pig.talk() // abadee abadee that's all folks
Object.setPrototypeOf(angry_pig, animal); // animal doesn't have sound
Object.setPrototypeOf(angry_pig, pig); // ADABEE ABADEE THATS ALL FOLKS
angry_pig.shout()
```
Example 8 - assignning a new value (function) to animal
```
function talk() {
  console.log(this.sound);  // 'meow!'
}

let animal = {
  talk       // key: talk, value: function talk()
}

let human = {
  sound: 'hey how are you?'
}

let pig = {
  sound: "abadee abadee that's all folks"
}

let angry_pig = {
  shout: function() {
    console.log(this.sound.toUpperCase())
  }
}

Object.setPrototypeOf(pig, animal);
animal.talk = function() {
  console.log('meep meep');
}
pig.talk() // meep meep
```

## Can I think of objects and classes in TypeScript similarly to how they work in Java? Do objects and classes really matter much TypeScript and JavaScript practically, since experts in the field say that usually functional programming that OOP?
Can be... similar but different

## The interior interface topic form Chapter 6 is my muddiest point.
JS
```
class Temperature {
  constructor(celsius) {
    this.celsius = celsius;
  }
  get fahrenheit() {
    return this.celsius * 1.8 + 32;
  }
  set fahrenheit(value) {
    this.celsius = (value - 32) / 1.8;
  }

  static fromFahrenheit(value) {
    return new Temperature((value - 32) / 1.8);
  }
}

let temp = new Temperature(22);
console.log(temp.fahrenheit);
// → 71.6
temp.fahrenheit = 86;
console.log(temp.celsius);
// → 30
```

## Could we talk a little bit about adding iterators to objects? It appears that the next() name is a predefined namespace for an iterator function of an iterable object.  I'm almost a hundred percent sure that's not correct though.
JS file
```
const dragons = [
  'cool dragon',
  'angry dragon',
  'nasty gradon'
]

const iterator = dragons[Symbol.iterator]()
iterator.next() // {value: 'cool dragon', done: false}
iterator.next() // {value: 'angry dragon', done: false}
iterator.next() // {value: 'nasty dragon', done: false}
iterator.next() // {value: 'undefined', done: true}

for (const char of dragons) {
  char // c, o, o, l, , d, r, a, g, o, Only the first 10 values are automatic
}

for (const dragon of dragons) {
  dragon // cool dragon, angry dragon, nasty dragon
}

```
- Symbols are unique keys
- Symbols are weird unique string to avoid conflicts
- `Symbol.iterator` is completely unique and doesn't exist anywhere else
- `[Symbol.iterator]` is a unique key / property for the object. Avoids naming conflicts
- the iterator behaves and have the `.next()` method
- the iterator interface `iterator.next()` works until we run of items.
- What? Iterator is an object that arrays spit out that you can use to iterate an array. Tells the outside world how to iterate.
- Why? So we can iterate over anything
