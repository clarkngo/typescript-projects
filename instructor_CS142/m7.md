# Module 7 - Asynchronous Programming and Integrating Code with JavaScript and TypeScript

# Agenda
- Modules
- Promises
- Async functions
- Generators
- Event loop

# Modules
- The relations between modules are called dependencies. When a module needs a piece from another module, it is said to depend on that module.
- To separate modules in that way, each needs its own private scope.
- Modules are executed within their own scope, not in the global scope; this means that variables, functions, classes, etc. declared in a module are not visible outside the module unless they are explicitly exported using one of the `export`

- Just putting your JavaScript code into different files does not satisfy these requirements. The files still share the same global namespace. They can, intentionally or accidentally, interfere with each other’s bindings.

In the Node.js module system, each file is treated as a separate module.

Modules are the fundamental building blocks of the code structure. The module system allows you to organize your code, hide information and only expose the public interface of a component using module.exports. Every time you use the require call, you are loading another module.

How does require work?

The module loading mechanism in Node.js is caching the modules on the first require call. It means that every time you use require('awesome-module') you will get the same instance of awesome-module, which ensures that the modules are singleton-like and have the same state across your application.
## Example Set 1
Example - add
```
// add.js
function add (a, b) {
  return a + b
}

module.exports = add
```
Main file:
```
// index.js
const add = require('./add')

console.log(add(4, 5))
```

## Example Set 2
Example - Circle module
```
const { PI } = Math;

exports.area = (r: number) => PI * r ** 2;

exports.circumference = (r: number) => 2 * PI * r;
```
Example - use circle module in a different file

On the first line, `demo.js` loads the module `circle.js` that is in the same directory as `demo.js`.

```
const circle = require('./circle.js');
console.log(`The area of a circle of radius 4 is ${circle.area(4)}`);
```

The module `circle.js` has exported the functions `area()` and `circumference()`. Functions and objects are added to the root of a module by specifying additional properties on the special exports object.

## Example Set 3
```
// Assigning to exports will not modify module, must use module.exports
module.exports = class Square {
  constructor(width) {
    this.width = width;
  }

  area() {
    return this.width ** 2;
  }
};
```
In `demo.js`,
```
const Square = require('./square.js');
const mySquare = new Square(2);
console.log(`The area of mySquare is ${mySquare.area()}`);
```
# Promises
- Similar to callbacks
- A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future
- An object which can be returned synchronously from an asynchronous function
Example - promise
```
let p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let a = 1 + 1;
  if (a == 2) {
    resolve('Success');
  } else {
    reject('Failed');
  }
})

p.then((message) => {
  console.log('This is in the then ' + message)
}).catch((message) => {
  console.log('This is in the catch ' + message)
})
```
Example - A callback

Note: change the boolean values for demo
```
const userLeft = false;
const userWatchingCatMeme = true;

function watchTutorialCallBack(callback, errorCallback) {
  if (userLeft) {
    errorCallback({
      name: 'User Left',
      message: ':('
    })
  } else if (userWatchingCatMeme) {
    errorCallback({
      name: 'User Watching Cat Meme',
      message: 'Cat > WebDevSimplified'
    })
  } else {
    callback('Thumbs up and Subscribe');
  }
}

watchTutorialCallBack((message) => {
  console.log('Success: ' + message);
}, (error) => {
  console.log(error.name + ' ' + error.message)
});
```
Example - refactor to promise
```
const userLeft = false;
const userWatchingCatMeme = true;

function watchTutorialPromise() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    ////
  })
}
```
Example - refactor continuination
```
const userLeft = false;
const userWatchingCatMeme = true;

function watchTutorialPromise() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (userLeft) {
      reject({
        name: 'User Left',
        message: ':('
      });
    } else if (userWatchingCatMeme) {
      reject({
        name: 'User Watching Cat Meme',
        message: 'Cat > WebDevSimplified'
      });
    } else {
      resolve('Thumbs up and Subscribe');
    }
  });
}

watchTutorialPromise().then((message) => {
  console.log('Success: ' + message);
}).catch((error) => {
  console.log(error.name + ' ' + error.message);
})
```

Instead of creating callbacks within callbacks within callbacks, which is callback hell.

We can just keep using `.then` (and then)
Example - instead of callbacks and callbacks
```
watchTutorialPromise().then((message) => {
  console.log('Success: ' + message)
}).then((message) => {
  console.log('Success: ' + message)
}).catch((error) => {
  console.log(error.name + ' ' + error.message)
})
```
## Example Set 3 - Promise APIs
Example - Promise All

Note: `.all` then `.then`. The `.then` get an array parameter.

They will run in parallel
```
const recordVideoOne = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve('Video 1 Recorded');
});
const recordVideoTwo = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve('Video 2 Recorded');
});
const recordVideoThree = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve('Video 3 Recorded');
});

Promise.all([
  recordVideoOne,
  recordVideoTwo,
  recordVideoThree
]).then((messages) => {
  console.log(messages);
});
```
Example - Promise Race

Small functions hence will run in the same order
```
Promise.race([
  recordVideoOne,
  recordVideoTwo,
  recordVideoThree
]).then((messages) => {
  console.log(messages);
})
```

# Generators
- A function that can stop midway and continue from where it stop
- Pausable functions
- Usually used with Promises
- yield keyword is used to resume or pause a generator function asynchronously. A generator function is just like a normal function but the difference is that whenever the function is returning any value, it does it with the help of ‘yield’ keyword instead of return it. Yield can’t be called from nested functions or from callbacks.
- The yield expression returns an object with two properties, “value” which is the actual value and “done” which is a boolean value, it returns true when generator function is full completed else it returns false.
- If we pause the yield expression, the generator function will also get paused and resumes only when we call the next() method. When the next() method is encountered the function keeps on working until it faces another yield or returns expression.
## Example Set 1
Example - not a generator
```
function normalFunc() {
  console.log('I')
  console.log('cannot')
  console.log('be')
  console.log('stopped.')
}
```
Example - generator
```
function * generatorFunction() { // Line 1
  console.log('This will be executed first.');
  yield 'Hello, ';   // Line 2
  console.log('I will be printed after the pause');
  yield 'World!';
}
const generatorObject = generatorFunction(); // Line 3
console.log(generatorObject.next().value); // Line 4
console.log(generatorObject.next().value); // Line 5
console.log(generatorObject.next().value); // Line 6
// This will be executed first.
// Hello,
// I will be printed after the pause
// World!
// undefined
```

## Example Set 2
Example - Without generators
```
const lifts = ['squat', 'bench', 'deadlift', 'press'];
const numWeeks = 3;
const daysPerWeek = 6;

const totalNumSessions = numWeeks * daysPerWeek;

let currentLiftIndex = 0;

// This creates an empty array of totalNumSessions length
// for me to map over
const cycle = [...Array(totalNumSessions)].map(() => ({
    lift: lifts[currentLiftIndex++ % lifts.length]
}));
```
Example - with generators
```
function* repeatedArray(arr) {
  let index = 0;
  while (true) {
    yield arr[index++ % arr.length];
  }
}

const lifts = ['squat', 'bench', 'deadlift', 'press'];
const nextLiftGenerator = repeatedArray(lifts);

const numWeeks = 3;
const daysPerWeek = 6;

const totalNumSessions = numWeeks * daysPerWeek;

// This creates an empty array of totalNumSessions length
// for me to map over
const cycle = [...Array(totalNumSessions)].map(() => ({
  lift: nextLiftGenerator.next().value,
}));
```
# Async Functions & Event loop
- JavaScript code is executed in an event loop, on a single thread. The reality is that all JavaScript executes synchronously - it's the event loop that allows you to queue up an action that won't take place until the loop is available some time after the code that queued the action has finished executing. So code is said to execute asynchronoulsy when it is queued to run sometime after the event loop is available.

Example - synchronous
```
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

function square(n) {
  return multiply(n, n);
}

function printSquared(n){
  let squared = square(n);
  console.log(squared);
}

printSquared(4);
```
Example - recursion
```
function recursion() {
  return recursion();
}

recursion();
```
Example - asynchronous
```
console.log('Legend');
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log('of');
}, 5000);

console.log('Zelda');

# Muddiest Points
## generator functions
- lecture
## difference between synchronous and asynchronous

## Synchronizing will be important in getting your TS and JS to work together in the future

## module interfaces vs object interfaces

## I'm a little confused about the findRoute() method in the text. It looks like a route-finding algorithm alright but I can't quite parse it. Could we go over it in class?

## Can any program written to be asynchronous also be written to be synchronous, since asynchronous is more complex?
Simply put: A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing — hence the name ‘call back’.

More complexly put: In JavaScript, functions are objects. Because of this, functions can take functions as arguments, and can be returned by other functions. Functions that do this are called higher-order functions. Any function that is passed as an argument is called a callback function.

## When it comes to a Stack vs a Queue , is it a stylistic choice or are there major compilation differences?
- Stack/Queue are ideal for enforcing sequential rules of access (LIFO & FIFO as you stated) while Array is ideal for allowing random access as desired.

Let me give some real life examples (since OOP programming often mimics real world scenarios) :
Stack : Washing of plates - the one at the top gets washed first.
Queue : Booking movie tickets (offline mode :P )
Array : Visit to a grocery store where the customer picks what he wants.


Example 1
```
function doHomework(subject, callback) {
  alert(`Starting my ${subject} homework.`);
  callback();
}

doHomework('math', function() {
  alert('Finished my homework');
});
```
Example 2 - refactor
```
function doHomework(subject, callback) {
  alert(`Starting my ${subject} homework.`);
  callback();
}

doHomework('math', function() {
  alert('Finished my homework');
});

## Asynchronicity and crows?

## CommonJS. Now tht there is a built-in modules system. is CommonJS still used and if so what is it used for. Also, why is Node.JS needed for JavaScript.
- CommonJS is the module specification standard used in Node.js.
- The JavaScript language didn’t have a native way of organizing code before the ES2015 standard. Node.js filled this gap with the CommonJS module format.
